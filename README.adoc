== Setup the CNApy development environment with conda

We use conda as package manager to install all dependencies. You can use https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html[miniconda].
If you have conda installed you can:

  ❯ conda env create -n cnapy -f environment.yml


. Activate the cnapy conda environment

  ❯ conda activate cnapy

. Download cnapy

.. either use `git`
      
  ❯ git clone https://github.com/cnapy-org/CNApy.git

.. or click on the big green button above, download and unpack zip archive. The folder is then `CNApy-master` not `CNApy`.

. Change into the source directory and install CNApy
  
  ❯ cd CNApy
  ❯ python setup.py install

. Run CNApy
      
  ❯ cnapy


IMPORTANT: To use the CNA MATLAB functions you need atleast MATLAB 2019b and the Python API for the MATLAB engine installed and of course CNA
